As of September 5th:

Patch notes:
	Front end:
		Add shared URL for the Beer Lover or Brewer Components to reuse.
		Added a radio to register
		Adjusted handleSubmit to pass state.role into user object's role field
		Wrapped all inputs in Register.js in a form
		Wrapped the submit button and link in separate divs
		Changed 'log in' text to 'register' in the submit button in register.js
		Adjusted radio to pass their value into state
		Added a default of Beer Lover to radio choices.
		Added onChangeValue to register. This lets us pass different roles when a user registers.
		Added basic component for Brewers(To use later)
		Added basic component to Beer Lovers(To use later)
	Back end:
		Created a script for creating a brewery table
		Created BreweryDao interface and JdbcBreweryDao Class(create function unfisnished)
		Created a Brewery Controller
		Created a Brewery Model

Note some stylings might be weird since I added this in. Otherwise
it SHOULD be functioning. Still need to actually access roles to display
different components once on the home page.

As of September 9th:

Patch notes:
	Back end:
		Adjusted brewery.sql to provide some basic inserts to get you started
		Adjusted breweryController create methods to make sure we can add new ones
		Adjusted search by name and search by location endpoints for specificity
		Created profile dao, controller, and model
		Tested all endpoints to ensure they work

Note the JSON object profile will expect would look like:
	profile {username: 'someUsername', profileType: 'their type'};
Keep in mind the keys you pass. The brewery object would look like:
	brewery {name: 'some name', location: 'some location'}
If a post method doesn't seem to work check your key names.
